# disqus
(I fixed the form execute error because it seems later PKP changed its code base, now this plugin should work with 3.3 LTS. If you use original author's plugin and find the "Failed Ajax request or invalid JSON returned" this should get you fixed)
A very simple Disqus plugin for OJS/OPS/OMP 3.2+

The plugin adds Disqus commenting to abstract pages. You need to register a Disqus account https://disqus.com/ and give the forum name to the plugin settings page.
